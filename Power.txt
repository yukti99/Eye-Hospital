Power and lenses

a nearsighted person who needs a –1.00 diopter lens can see objects at one metre clearly, 
but anything farther is blurred. Someone with a –2.00 diopter measurement requires a lens that is twice as powerful –
so they can only see objects up to a 1/2 metre away clearly.
A –3.00 lens would mean the person can only see a distance of up to 1/3 of a metre clearly, and so on. 
Most nearsighted people are in the range of -1.50 to -7.00 diopters, which is considered mild to moderate.

On the other hand, a farsighted person who needs a +1.00 diopter lens can see objects at one metre clearly, 
but anything closer than that is blurred. 
A +2.00 lens indicates someone can see things at 1/2 metre and beyond clearly, but nothing closer.
